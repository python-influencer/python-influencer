- 👋 Hi, I’m @python-influencer. In fatc, I am a Cybersecurity and IT Risk Analyst with over 12 years of experience in identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks across various industries such as oil and gas, petrochemical, pharmaceuticals, and steel.
  
- 👀 I’m deeply passionate about developing and refining Cybersecurity Risk Assessment Methodologies to help organizations achieve precise and actionable insights into their risk posture.
      My work focuses on designing comprehensive frameworks for identifying vulnerabilities, assessing risk levels, and prioritizing mitigation strategies.
  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how Python and its extensive libraries—such as NumPy, pandas, and matplotlib—can be leveraged for accurate risk assessments and data-driven decision-making.
     I am also exploring how to develop a comprehensive Python library tailored for IT and Cybersecurity Risk Assessment, integrating features like threat modeling, real-time risk calculations, and reporting automation.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that aim to build innovative tools for Risk Analysis and Assessment, especially in areas like IT and OT environments.
     I am particularly interested in working on open-source initiatives that make risk management methodologies accessible and scalable.
